                    In the following policy, <strong>Ferro VPN</strong> refers to the service offered by Ferro (the "Company" or "We") through the <strong>ferrovpn.com</strong> website and the software provided through it (the "Service").

                <p>
                    Our Company is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. It is our overriding policy to collect as little user information as possible to ensure a private and anonymous user experience when using the Service.

                    <p class="mb-0">
                        <strong>Ferro VPN is a strictly No-Logs VPN service.</strong> To ensure your absolute privacy and safety, we have designed our systems so that we do not have any sensitive data to share, even if compelled by law.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-4 text-text-main">
                        <li>We do NOT log your browsing history.</li>
                        <li>We do NOT log traffic data or content of communications.</li>
                        <li>We do NOT log DNS queries.</li>
                        <li>We do NOT log your original IP address.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-main mt-12 mb-4">Information We Collect</h3>
                <p>
                    We intentionally limit data collection to the absolute minimum required to operate the Service. We categorize data into two types: <strong>Account Data</strong> and <strong>Activity Data</strong>.
                </p>

                <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-main mt-6 mb-2">1. Account Information (For Service Delivery)</h4>
                <p>
                    To provide you with our Service (e.g., verifying your Premium subscription), we may require you to authenticate using a third-party provider such as <strong>Google</strong> or <strong>Apple</strong>.
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
                    <li>We collect only the unique User ID or Email Address provided by Google/Apple for authentication purposes.</li>
                    <li>This information is used <strong>solely</strong> to verify your identity and manage your subscription limit (e.g., the 2-device limit).</li>
                    <li><strong>Crucially:</strong> This Account Data is stored separately and is <strong>NEVER linked</strong> to your online traffic or browsing activity. We know <em>who</em> has an account, but we do not know <em>what</em> that account does online.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-main mt-6 mb-2">2. Activity Data (Zero-Logs)</h4>
                <p>
                    As stated in our strictly No-Logs Policy, we do <strong>NOT</strong> collect, store, or monitor any Activity Data (traffic, DNS, IPs, history).
                </p>

                <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-text-main mt-6 mb-2">Using our native applications</h4>
                <p>
                    When you use our native apps, we may collect anonymous, aggregate analytics to help us improve stability and performance. This may include:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
                    <li>Aggregate statistics on device types (e.g., percentage of Android vs. iOS users).</li>
                    <li>Total number of active users (without identifying individuals).</li>
                    <li>Crash reports (optional and anonymized) to fix bugs rapidly.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>None of our software will ever access or track your real-time location (GPS) or any personally identifiable usage data.</strong>
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-main mt-12 mb-4">Data Security</h3>
                <p>
                    We take data security serious. Access to our infrastructure is strictly controlled. All Ferro VPN servers are encrypted and run in a manner that prevents the permanent storage of user activity data. Because we do not log your session data, there is no data to be stolen or leaked.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-main mt-12 mb-4">Disclosure of Information</h3>
                <p>
                    Since Ferro VPN does not store logs of your online activity, IP addresses, or traffic data, <strong>we cannot disclose this information to any third party, including law enforcement or government authorities, simply because we do not possess it.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will only disclose the limited non-personal data we possess (if any) when compelled by law by a competent court of jurisdiction. However, this will never include your browsing history or traffic data, as these do not exist in our systems.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-main mt-12 mb-4">Your Rights (GDPR & CCPA)</h3>
                <p>
                    Under applicable data protection laws (such as GDPR and CCPA), you have rights regarding your personal data. However, since Ferro VPN is a No-Logs service, we do not hold personal data that can be linked to your specific online activity.
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Right to Access & Deletion:</strong> You may request to access or delete personal data (such as account email, if applicable).</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to anonymity:</strong> You have the right to use our service without providing excessive personal information.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-main mt-12 mb-4">Changes to this Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    The Company reserves the right to review and change this Policy. Since strictly protecting user privacy is our core value, any changes will only reinforce this commitment.
                </p>
